# My Motto 

Change yourself, Change your organization, Change the world ! 
# Things I like

- 📖 "Science Fiction novels" are the books I would carry to an island, when I am shipwrecked. I love books by Andy Weir and Ted Chaing. My favorite book is 'Project HailMary' and  'Story of Your Life'. I figure I love stories about outer space and aliens. Maybe someday I hope I would be showing my blog to random stranger in space? 
- 🏂 I am a great skiier, fencer, horseback rider. I enjoy many challenges. I have been skiing since I was 4 years old. I learned fencing since 2020, and I participated in amateur fencing competition (I never got any medal..) but still,the oppurtunity to stab some random stranger doesn't come easily.
- 📊 I am interested in studies about studying efficiently. I always experiment with tools that would make me more productive. I am really adaptive to new things. 
- 🌎 Traveling is the source of my life and passion. I have been to many countries, and by far Spain was my favorite country. I can never forget the codfish I ate in Barcellona after a long long walk!
